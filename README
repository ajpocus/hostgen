- Introduction -

Hostgen is a utility for automatically generating /etc/hosts files.

- Where to get it -

Hostgen can be found on github, at this address:

- What you need -

    I built hostgen on Arch Linux i686, kernel 2.6.35, with Perl 5.12.1. As 
long as you have a recent version of Linux with Perl >= 5.10, you should be 
fine. It may work with older versions of Perl, but this hasn't been tested.
Anything earlier than 5.8 is probably a bad idea.

- How it works -

    Hostgen is actually two programs: hostgen-srv, and hostgen-cli. Hostgen-srv
is the central server, creating hostsfile entries from connected clients, with
no user intervention necessary. The client program simply contacts that server, and it's done. The server appends the client's hostname and IP to hostgen.out.

- Usage -

    On the server, in the directory where hostgen-srv is saved, run:

./hostgen-srv &

    Then on each client, run:

./hostgen-cli -s <server IP>

    The server will write the hosts file to ./hostgen.out.

- Caveats -

    Hostgen does not directly write the /etc/hosts file. This allows hostgen to be run as a normal user, but adds a manual copying step. It also doesn't check 
for existing entries, or do anything about duplicate entries. This will create 
problems if a user wishes to update their entry; until then, hostgen isn't as 
robust as it could be.
